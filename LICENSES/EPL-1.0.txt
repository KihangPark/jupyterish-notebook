Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
       i) changes to the Program, and
       ii) additions to the Program;
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or in
 combination with the Program.
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
   a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
   b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
      object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
      the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
      added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
      combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
      shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
      No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

3. REQUIREMENTS
   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
   its own license agreement, provided that:
   a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
   b) its license agreement includes a prohibition against reverse engineering,
      decompilation, and disassembly of the Program, a disclaimer of warranty,
      and limitation of liability substantially similar to those contained
      herein.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
   respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
   intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor
   who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
   manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.

5. NO WARRANTY
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
   AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   RECIPIENT AGREES THAT NEITHER CONTRIBUTOR NOR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTORS SHALL
   HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
   OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
   remainder of the terms of this Agreement.
